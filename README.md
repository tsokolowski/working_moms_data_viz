## Description

#### Project Background

The broad goal of my thesis is to increase opportunities for women to access leadership positions. Through my research, I have learned that a pivotal moment in a woman's career is when she has her first child. During this time, a woman is faced with difficult decisions affecting her as an employee and as a mother. When workplaces aren’t supportive of a new mom’s needs and goals, it may lead to her leaving her job, which ultimately limits her opportunities for leadership positions in the future. This is why I am focusing my thesis specifically on supporting new moms to have a successful transition back to work after having a child.

#### Project Goal

For my final project for this class, I wanted to create a simple visualization that explained my thesis problem through key statistics. Many people often don't understand the direct connection between targeting new moms returning to work after maternity leave and my larger goal of increasing opportunities for women to access leadership positions, so I wanted this to be a way of bringing that story to life.

## My Process

#### Data Collection and Processing

There are a lot of studies and statistics being thrown around on the topic of gender equality in the workplace, especially in the era of #metoo and #timesup. For my thesis, I created a spreadsheet of all the studies, key findings, and statistics related to my research as a central hub of information. Through doing this, I quickly realized how many different, and sometimes contradictory, statistics there are out there, and how many stereotypes and myths there are related to women, and especially moms, in the workplace. 

For this project, I parsed through all the various statistics and data points that helped to "debunk" myths about working mothers and tell a compelling story of how a woman's career is affected by becoming a mom. I also focused on pulling data from trustworthy sources that displayed similar statistics. This included the report, Women in the Workplace, from McKinsey & Company and the report, The Slowly Narrowing Gender Wage Gap, from the Institute for Women's Policy Research. 

#### Visualization Selection

Once I pulled all of the statistics I wanted to include, I created a narrative that would weave them together and tell a story  about how a woman's career is affected when she becomes a mom. For the visualizations, I wanted to create something simple but impactful, where someone could visually see the differences between the key statistics at a quick glance. To do this I chose to represent each statistic with icons of women, where each icon would represent one woman. 

For the first statistic (20% of corporate CEO's are women), I choose to visualize it as "1 in 5" in order to make it very tangible and relatable. The visual shows 1 woman icon and 4 men icons to see how underrepresented women are at the c-suite level.

For the second and third statistics (2% of woman plan to leave the workforce for family reasons, but 43% of women scale back at work after having a child and 27% quit their job at some point to care for children), I wanted to show 100 women (equiavalent of 100%) for each visualization to be able to directly compare them and see the impact. Ultimately, I wanted to show how only 2 out of 100 women planned to change their careers to care for children, but 70 out of 100 ended up making changes. This was to debunk the myth that most women leave work or don't become senior leaders because they *choose* to, and emphaize that that may not have been their original plan or goal.

For the final statistic (women who took 1 year off from work earned 39% less than those that didn’t and those that took 4 or more years off earned 65% less), I chose to just compare 3 representative women and create a simple bar graph of their difference in earnings.
